# Maintained EasyTier dependency

This branch extends the maintained Quinn 0.11.19 protocol checkpoint
`061829d212090b87e471d94cba890acd5cffa933`, paired with Quinn 0.11.12 and
quinn-udp 0.5.16. It retains application-limited BBR fixes and bounded byte-rate
pacing, and adds the scoped HY2 alignment described in
[HY2-RUST-UPSTREAM.md](HY2-RUST-UPSTREAM.md).

Chrome wire shaping and HY2 window/profile options are explicit. Ordinary Quinn
builds and default settings retain their existing contracts. The `hy2-rustls`
feature requires EasyTier's TLS patch; default builds use official rustls.
Adaptive loss thresholds and extended receive-history experiments remain archived.

EasyTier selects an exact Git revision in Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock. Updating
this branch alone does not update its consumer. Validate both protocol and
consumer paths before changing the pin or deploying. Historical experiments
remain under `archive/*` tags; restoring one does not authorize its integration.
`dev` is the integration branch; preserve `main` and its history.
